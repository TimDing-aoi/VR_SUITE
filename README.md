# VR_SUITE
## VR setup
You will need 1 head set, 2 light houses, 1 link box and multiple connection cables. Connect as of the instructions of the vive setup/steam VR setup.
Make sure the light houses are working and see each other and the headset from a clear and fixed view, then calibrate through steamVR -> room setup -> standing only.
Install the SR runtime and start the VR_SUITE program.
You should see a fixed view of the field, and able to move around with the joy stick.
